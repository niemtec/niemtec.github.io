I am a software developer primarily working with C# and various microservice technologies, I try to write and read in my spare time. This is page is a focal point for the content that is "ready" to be seen by the web or somehow made it out of my notebooks.

Enthusiast of pretty graphs, strong coffee, notebooks, and good quality paper.
