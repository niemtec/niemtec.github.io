<h2 id="what-is-the-feynman-technique">What is the Feynman Technique?</h2>
<p>The Feynman Technique doesn’t let us fool ourselves into thinking we are masters of a subject when we are really amateurs. Each step of the process forces us to confront what we don’t know, engage directly with the material, and clarify our understanding.</p>
<p>It consists of <strong>four</strong> steps which can, in theory, be used to learn any topic. It rejects memorisation and automated recall (which doesn’t sufficiently engage your brain).</p>
<p>The technique encourages learning because it involves breaking down the concept or idea and writing it down in plain and clear language (simple enough for a kid to understand) which forces you to understand the topic at a much deeper level.</p>
<h2 id="core-steps">Core Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Choose a concept to learn</strong>: Select a topic you’re interested in learning about and write it at the top of a blank page in a notebook</li>
<li><strong>Teach it to someone</strong>: Pretend you are teaching it to a child. Write your explanation down or say it out loud in a way that a child could understand it</li>
<li><strong>Return to the material if you get stuck</strong>: Identify any gaps in your own understanding that show up when you try to simplify the concept. Go back to source material and find the information you need</li>
<li><strong>Simplify explanations and create analogies</strong>: Review and simplify your explanation again. Streamline your notes and explanation, further clarifying the topic until it seems obvious</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="choose-a-concept-to-learn">Choose a Concept to Learn</h2>
<p>Select a topic that is small enough that it can reasonably fit onto one or several pages.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You face what you don’t know</strong>: By writing the topic down on an empty page you visually acknowledge that you are starting from scratch</li>
<li><strong>You need to be specific</strong>: Writing down explicitly what you don’t know provides you with a starting point</li>
<li><strong>You have to start small</strong>: You really only have a page (or a few) to fill up with information. You can’t fit everything on it</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="explain-it-to-yourself">Explain it to Yourself</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”
(Richard Feynman)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A classic learning mistake is reading an article or textbook and considering our learning complete. In reality, <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/">reading is not understanding</a> — true understanding requires a more active process like teaching. Start out by formally teaching yourself.</p>
<p>Write out a summary in your own words without looking at your notes or explain it to yourself out loud. Teaching also initiates a feedback loop, where critique or questions can help us learn and sharpen our thinking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It makes it harder to trick yourself</strong>: When you truly explain something, you encounter the holes in your reasoning and gaps in knowledge</li>
<li><strong>You build confidence</strong>: When you truly understand something, it clicks. You can explain it forward and backwards, pointing out exceptions and spotting logical inconsistencies</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="return-to-source-material">Return to Source Material</h2>
<p>Learning should be iterative, often learning something challenging takes several attempts. When we find gaps in our knowledge, revisiting the primary and secondary sources can help solidify what we’re learning.</p>
<p>Getting it right will likely take several iterations. That’s a good thing; the more you refine your explanations, the more your understanding will deepen.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning becomes an interactive process</strong>: Rather than viewing learning as one-and-done, this step gives you permission to continuously refresh your knowledge</li>
<li><strong>You’re actively engaged</strong>: Using sources to polish our own explanations and models is an active process. When we learn passively, committing details to memory is more challenging</li>
<li><strong>You expand your knowledge base</strong>: Paradoxically, the more we learn, the more our capacity to learn increases</li>
</ul>
